# Sparta_Global_OOPlab

This small project is to demonstrate and practice use of Object Oriented Programming ideas and methods in Ruby to produce a number of classes.
The structure is based on a zoo. All inhabitants of the zoo share certain properties, but staff and animals have many different properties and methods too. Each therefore has a seperate class but inherits from the zoo inhabitant class. A gibbon inherits from the animal class, and uses polymorphism to override certain functions. Finally the environments module can be accessed to grant information about an inhabitant's habitat. 
Across the small system, there are examples of inheritance (and the use of super), dynamic polymorphism, class methods & instance methods.
